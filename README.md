## Usage

The work-day-scheduler will automatically update with color styling depending on the current time. 

In order to add an event to a block of time, a user can ‘click’ into a block and add in text. After adding in text, a ‘save’ button must be ‘clicked’ in order for the newly added item to be saved to the local storage. 

In order to delete, or update an agenda item, the user must update in the block of time, and ‘click’ on the save button in order for the change to take effect.
